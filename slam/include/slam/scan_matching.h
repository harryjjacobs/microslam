/**
 * @brief Compute the gradient of the scan matching cost function.
 * The cost function is the sum of the squared distances to the nearest leaf:
 * E(p)=âˆ‘_i(d(T_p(s_i)))^2
 *
 * where p is the pose, s_i is the scan point, T_p(s_i) is the transformed
 * scan point s_i in world space and d is the distance to the nearest leaf in
 * the quadtree.
 *
 * The gradient is computed using finite differences, and the sum of the
 * squared distances is returned in the sum parameter.
 *
 * The gradient can be thought of as the direction in which the cost
 * function decreases the fastest, and the magnitude of the gradient
 * indicates how steep the cost function is in that direction.
 *
 * @param occupancy The occupancy quadtree of the map
 * @param scan The scan to match to the map
 * @param pose The pose of the robot in world space when the scan was taken
 * @param gradient The gradient of the cost function w.r.t. the pose
 * @param sum The sum of the squared distances to the nearest leaf
 *
 * @return uint16_t 1 if the gradient was computed successfully,
 * 0 if not enough matches were found.
